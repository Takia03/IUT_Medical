Leveraging GitHub for collaboration, Overleaf for documentation, and Google Meet/Discord for communication, the project ensures efficient teamwork. Key features include prescription management, inventory tracking, and billing processes integration for enhanced healthcare operations. Ultimately, this project seeks to elevate patient care standards and improve healthcare efficiency.
