- The system should be able to maintain a list of students, including their **ID**, **name**, **department**, and **email**.
- Students should be uniquely identified by their **student ID**.

### 2. Doctor Management:
- The system should facilitate the management of doctors ,storing their **ID**, **name**, **specialization**, and **email**.
- Doctors should be identifiable by their respective **IDs**.

### 3. Visit Recording:
- It should enable the recording of student visits to the medical center, capturing the **visit ID**, **student ID**, **doctor ID**, **visit date and time**.
- Each visit should be identifiable by their respective **IDs**.

### 4. Prescription Management:
- It should support the creation and management of prescriptions, including comments from the attending doctor, prescription ID, and associated visit ID.
- Each prescription should be linked to an attendance record. 6. 

### 5. Medicine Inventory:
- The system should maintain an inventory of medicines available at the medical center, including details such as medicine ID, name, generic name, and producer.
